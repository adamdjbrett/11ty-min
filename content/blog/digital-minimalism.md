excerpt: "Practical strategies for a less distracting digital life"

Our devices are designed to capture and hold our attention. Digital minimalism is the practice of being intentional about which tools we use and how we use them.

## The Attention Economy

Tech companies profit from our attention. Every notification, every feature, every social network is optimized to keep us engaged. But engagement ≠ fulfillment.

Digital minimalism isn't about rejecting technology. It's about using technology as a tool, not as the primary source of entertainment and connection.

## Practical Strategies

### 1. Unsubscribe Ruthlessly
Delete newsletters you don't read. Leave groups that drain your energy. Your inbox is sacred real estate.

### 2. Turn Off Notifications
You don't need to know every like, comment, or message instantly. Batch your communication.

### 3. Delete Social Media Apps
If you use social media, do it from a browser. The friction of logging in helps you make conscious choices.

### 4. One Tool Per Job
Don't have five note-taking apps. Choose one. Don't have three calendars. Pick the best one and commit.

### 5. Device-Free Time
Establish times when devices aren't welcome. Meals, first hour of morning, last hour before bed.

## The Paradox of Choice

More features don't make tools better. They make them harder to use. The most powerful tools are often the simplest ones.

Constraints foster creativity. Limitations force intentionality.

## Measuring Success

You'll know digital minimalism is working when:
- You spend less time on devices without feeling you're missing out
- Your focus improves
- You feel less anxious about messages and notifications
- You have more time for what actually matters

Start with one change. Notice what shifts.
