excerpt: "How removing things can add value to your life and work"

The most powerful design decisions aren't about what you add—they're about what you remove.

## Less Is More Than Just a Phrase

When we talk about minimalism, people often think of empty spaces and sparse rooms. But minimalism is fundamentally about clarity. It's the practice of removing everything that doesn't serve a purpose or bring joy.

This applies equally to:
- Your physical space
- Your digital life
- Your work and projects
- Your writing and communication

## The Discipline of Subtraction

Subtraction requires discipline. Adding is easy—you just include more. Removing requires judgment: What's essential? What serves the core purpose? What can go?

In design, this principle is called "form follows function." The best products and interfaces are those where every element exists for a reason. Unnecessary decoration, extra clicks, redundant text—these are distractions from the core experience.

## Examples in Practice

**Writing:** The best writers are ruthless editors. Every sentence must earn its place.

**Code:** Clean code is minimal code. It does what it needs to do, nothing more.

**User Interfaces:** Every button, every color, every word should serve the user's goals.

**Life:** Owning fewer things means you can fully appreciate what you have.

## Getting Started

You don't need to embrace radical minimalism to benefit from subtraction. Start small:

1. Choose one area of your life
2. Ask: What's truly necessary here?
3. Remove one thing that doesn't meet that threshold
4. Notice how the essential becomes more visible

The simplicity on the other side of complexity is always more valuable than simplicity before complexity.
